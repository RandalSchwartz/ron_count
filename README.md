# ron_count

Happy retirement, Ron!

## Notes to people looking at this code

Ron has retired, so you don't get the cool countdown any more.
*However*, you can set the countdown ending to anything you want by changing the `final bye` value in line 80, which should just evaluate to any `DateTime` value.

There's a 47 minute video describing in detail how this was constructed and what the moving parts do, in my youtube channel at [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEPH_Ecg-A).
